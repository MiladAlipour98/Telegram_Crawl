# Telegram Data Crawling and Real-time Monitoring with ElasticSearch

This project focuses on crawling posts from the Telegram network, extracting user information and related posts, and storing them in an ElasticSearch database. Additionally, it involves real-time monitoring of a Telegram group, extracting relevant posts, and sending them to the database. The Telethon library, a popular and extensive library for interacting with the Telegram API, will be used for this project.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.6 or above installed.
- Access to the internet to download required libraries.
- A Telegram account.

## Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Go to [https://my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps) and create a new application. This will provide you with the `api_id` and `api_hash` values needed to authenticate your program with the Telegram API.

2. Install the required libraries. You can use `pip` to install the Telethon library:

   ```shell
   pip install telethon
   ```

   Additionally, install the Elasticsearch library:

   ```shell
   pip install elasticsearch
   ```

3. Create an ElasticSearch instance. You can use a hosted service like Elastic Cloud or set up a local instance of ElasticSearch.

4. Clone or create a new repository on GitHub to host your project.

5. Create a `README.md` file in your repository to document your project.

## Crawling and Storing Telegram Posts

The first part of the project involves crawling posts from the Telegram network and storing them in an ElasticSearch database.

## Real-time Monitoring and Posting

The second part of the project involves real-time monitoring of a Telegram group, extracting relevant posts, and sending them to the database. Additionally, a message will be sent in the group to indicate the successful execution of the process.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find any issues or have ideas for improvements, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the developers of the Telethon library and the ElasticSearch team for their contributions.
